# FHIR Tool-Ablation Eval — Final Honest Synthesis

**Does a clinical agent with a catalog of purpose-built FHIR tools beat Medplum's single generic `fhir_request` tool, on FHIR-AgentBench?**

*Substrate: FHIR-AgentBench (MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR demo, single-patient retrieval QA). Models: Claude Opus 4.8, GPT-5.5. Judge: gpt-5-mini LLM-as-judge (0/1 correctness). Paired stats: McNemar exact + paired bootstrap.*

---

## 1. Bottom line

This is a **null result, and a clean one.** Across two frontier models, a catalog of purpose-built FHIR tools showed **no statistically significant accuracy advantage** over Medplum's single generic `fhir_request` tool on single-patient retrieval. The original headline ("5 tools beat 1 by +11pp") was **confounded** — it folded in a context-budget/overflow artifact and had no paired statistics or controls, and it does not replicate on either model under rigorous testing. The **only robust, significant effect anywhere** is the context cap: `_include`/reference-resolution tools are token-hungry and overflow the default 32k budget, and fixing that — not adding tools — is what moved accuracy.

> **⚠️ Reproducibility status (read before citing any number).** This is exploratory work, and the
> runs were executed on ephemeral EC2 boxes that have been torn down. **Reproducible from committed
> artifacts:** the entire **GPT-5.5** side — the deterministic re-score curve + overflow taxonomy (§9.1),

> accuracies + paired stats, with per-question judge labels frozen in `medplum-eval/results/*.judged.json`
> and aggregates in `_scores.csv` / `_paired.json`. **Still NOT reproducible:** the **entire Opus run,
> including the cap-factorial** — its raw per-question data was never pulled off the box before teardown,
> so the headline "only robust effect" (cap-on-`arm_ref`, p=0.0005 → p_holm=0.005) is an *unreproduced

> the load-bearing claims; treat the Opus cap finding as credible-but-unverifiable.

---

## 2. The arc: how a +11pp win became a null

> **Prior art — the headline null is a replication, and we say so.** The parent FHIR-AgentBench paper's
> *own* ablation already found specialized retrieval does **not** beat generic: o4-mini single-turn,
> **generic FHIR Query Generator 0.25 vs specialized Retriever 0.22**, with the lift to the 0.50 ceiling
> coming from a **code interpreter**, not specialization ([arXiv 2509.19319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19319),
> Table 3; the paper also reports ~3M-token full records and that "naive loading consistently failed" at
> the fixed 32k cap). So the generic-vs-typed question was **already answered null in the literature we
> forked.** Our result corroborates it on a different tool surface (an MCP server's single generic tool).
> What this study *adds* is the method they did not run — paired statistics and a **manipulated** context-cap
> factorial (they held the cap fixed) — which is what lets us trace the apparent +11pp below to context
> budget. Read §2–§5 as "replicate the known null under stronger controls + isolate the cap as the real
> lever," not "discover that tools don't help."

> **Wider prior art (and why our null is still interesting).** In *general* agent work the direction
> "purpose-built/typed tools beat a generic shell" is **well established** — most cleanly by **GradleFixer**
> ([arXiv 2510.08640](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08640): domain-specific tools 81.4% pass@1 vs a
> general-purpose shell, with a graded shell→domain trend *and* a call-budget manipulation), and by
> **Thinker** ([arXiv 2503.21036](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21036): 68.3%→82.6% on τ-bench retail) — though
> neither reports paired/significance statistics. But in **clinical** work the only datapoint near our axis
> (FHIR-AgentBench's own ablation) shows generic **0.25 ≥ specialized 0.22**, so "typed beats generic" is
> **not** established for FHIR. The closest clinical neighbour, **FHIR-AgentEval**
> ([PMC12919212](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12919212/): best 60.6% success), holds the tool
> surface *constant* and ablates memory, not tool design. So our **exact cell** — generic-vs-typed on a real
> FHIR MCP tool surface, crossed with a context-cap factorial, analyzed with paired stats — is **unoccupied**,
> and our underpowered **null runs against the general "typed wins" direction**. Net verdict: **partially
> known** — the contribution is the method bundle + the honest null, not the direction.

**RUN-0 (original, confounded):** Generic Medplum tool ≈39% → 5-tool catalog ≈50%, a **+11pp** apparent win. This is the result that motivated the whole investigation. But it was measured **without any of the controls that would let you trust it**:

- **No cap-factorial.** The 32k vs 100k context cap was never varied. The 5-tool arm and the 1-tool arm were not matched on context budget, so any difference in how often each arm *overflowed* the cap got silently scored as a "tool quality" difference.
- **No paired statistics.** Arms weren't compared question-by-question (McNemar / paired bootstrap), so an 11pp gap across ~25–30 questions — which is **well inside the noise floor at that sample size** — was read as signal.
- **No coached-generic control.** Nobody checked whether simply *telling* the generic tool about `_include`/`_elements` (description-only coaching) closes the gap. So "the typed tools are better" was never separated from "the typed tools happen to do something the generic tool was never told to do."
- **No answerable-set accounting.** Overflowed/errored questions weren't separated from genuinely-wrong answers.

**RUN-1 (Opus, rigorous):** Re-ran the same comparison with a cap-factorial, paired McNemar/bootstrap, a coached-generic control, and answerable-set accounting. The +11pp **decomposed into nothing**: the structure-lift attributable to tool *design* was +8pp with a 95% CI of [-0.12, +0.28] and p=0.69 — indistinguishable from zero. Coaching the generic did **literally nothing** (Δ0.00). The lift that *was* real came from the **context cap** (p=0.039 / p=0.0005), not the tools.

**RUN-2 (GPT-5.5, nested staircase):** Re-ran across 1→2→4→5→6 tools on a second, stronger model. The curve is **flat and noisy (0.70–0.83)**, every paired step is null, and the 1-tool generic (0.80) is **never beaten** by the 5-tool catalog (0.767). The effect is model-specific *and* artifact-driven — it survives on neither model.

> An independent judge-free deterministic re-score of the GPT-5.5 raw answers (strict string/number match, see §9.1) reproduces the **flat *shape*** — control (1 tool) ≈ arm_ref (6 tools) — but it floors **~20pp below** the LLM judge (deterministic 0.55–0.61 vs judge 0.70–0.83), because strict matching misses semantic equivalents (e.g. `'urgent'=='UR'`). So the *null/flat conclusion* is not an LLM-judge artifact; only the absolute level is judge-dependent. **Reproducibility note (updated):** the GPT-5.5 LLM-judge accuracies in §3 were originally lost (the scoring run was clobbered) but have since been **recovered** by re-judging the surviving committed raw answers — the per-question labels are now frozen in `medplum-eval/results/*.judged.json` and the aggregates in `_scores.csv`, so the GPT side is recomputable. Only the **Opus** numbers remain reconstructed (no committed raw data).

## 3. All the numbers

### RUN-1 — Opus (claude-opus-4-8), rigorous, n=25 paired/cell

**MEDICATION slice** (answers spanning MedicationRequest → Medication):

| arm | tools | accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| control | 1 generic | 0.64 |
| control_include | 1 generic + `_include` coaching | 0.64 |
| arm_ref | 6 (incl. `resolve_references`) | 0.72 |

**Paired comparisons:**

| comparison | Δ | 95% CI | p | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| coaching-lift (control → control_include) | **0.00** | — | 1.0 | **NULL** — coaching did nothing |
| structure-lift (control_include → arm_ref) | +0.08 | [-0.12, +0.28] | 0.69 | **NULL** |
| total-lift (control → arm_ref) | +0.08 | [-0.08, +0.24] | 0.625 | **NULL** |
| **cap effect on control (32k → 100k)** | **+0.28** | — | **0.039** | **SIGNIFICANT** |
| **cap effect on arm_ref (32k → 100k)** | **+0.56** | — | **0.0005** | **HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT** |

> arm_ref @ 32k cap **overflowed on 20/25 questions** (scoring just 0.16) — its `_include` bundles blow the stock context budget.

**REPRESENTATIVE slice (n=25):** control 0.72 → arm_full8 (8 tools) 0.76, Δ +0.04, p=1.0 — **NULL**.

### RUN-2 — GPT-5.5 (gpt-5.5-2026-04-23), nested dose-response staircase, rep slice n=30

| tools | arm | raw acc | answerable acc | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (generic) | control | **0.80** | 0.80 | generic alone already near the top |
| 2 | cat2 | 0.70 | 0.875 | 6/30 overflowed |
| 4 | cat4 | 0.80 | 0.80 | |
| 5 | validated5 | 0.767 | 0.793 | 1 overflow |
| 6 (+`resolve_references`) | arm_ref | **0.833** | 0.833 | |
| 8 | arm_full8 | **INCOMPLETE** | — | OpenAI quota exhausted; 30/30 errored, agent never ran |

**Paired steps (ALL NULL):**

| step | Δ | p | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 → 2 | -0.10 | 0.375 | NULL |
| 2 → 4 | +0.10 | 0.375 | NULL |
| 4 → 5 | -0.033 | 1.0 | NULL |
| 5 → 6 | +0.067 | 0.625 | NULL |

Curve is flat/noisy across 0.70–0.83 with no significant climb.

---

## 4. The diminishing-returns question ("do too many tools hurt?")

**The honest answer: the 1→6 curve is flat; the strong form is untestable.**

- **What the curve shows (1→6 tools):** flat and noisy, 0.70–0.83, every paired step null (p ≥ 0.375). Adding tools buys no monotonic benefit.
- **The 5-vs-1 reality:** control (1 tool) = **0.80** ≥ validated5 (5 tools) = **0.767**. The 5-tool arm did **not** beat the 1-tool arm — it was, if anything, marginally worse. This directly inverts the RUN-0 premise.
- **The honest caveat — do NOT claim "too many tools hurt":** the 8-tool endpoint is **incomplete**. All 30 arm_full8 records are `RateLimitError: exceeded your current quota` — **0 LLM calls, the 8-tool agent never executed a single question.** There is no 8-tool datapoint. The flat 1→6 trend *refutes a monotonic-benefit story* and is *weakly consistent* with "more tools don't help," but it is **not** evidence for an overload cliff. Claiming "too many tools hurt" would be inventing the one datapoint we don't have. The disciplined statement is: **"flat through 6 tools; the 8-tool endpoint failed to run."**

---

## 5. The one real finding: context budget / `_include` overflow

The only robust, significant lever in the entire experiment is the **context cap**, isolated by the Opus cap-factorial. *(Caveat from §1: this is from the destroyed Opus run — credible, externally corroborated, but not recomputable from committed artifacts. The mechanism, not the exact p-value, is the takeaway.)*

- **control, 32k → 100k:** 0.36 → 0.64, Δ **+0.28**, **p=0.039** (significant; but does **not** survive Holm — see §9.3).
- **arm_ref, 32k → 100k:** 0.16 → 0.72, Δ **+0.56**, **p=0.0005** (the one effect that survives Holm, p_holm=0.005).
- At the 32k cap, **arm_ref overflowed 20/25 questions** — its `resolve_references`/`_include` bundles are payload-heavy and blow the stock budget.
- On GPT-5.5, `cat2` overflowed several of 30 and `validated5` 1/30 — and notably `cat2` overflows even at the **raised 100k cap**, not just at 32k. Same mechanism; it *strengthens* "token economics dominate" while complicating any "just raise the cap and it's fixed" reading.

**The mechanism:** what looked like "purpose-built tools make the agent smarter" was substantially "the larger-context arm dodged a context-overflow cliff the harness imposed." **FHIR tool ergonomics on frontier models are dominated by token economics, not tool count.** `_include`/reference-resolution is a concrete context-budget trap: if you give an agent FHIR tools, design for payload size, not tool-surface area.

---

## 6. Illustrative traces (GPT-5.5, control vs arm_ref)

**Case A — both correct, generic is *more* detailed.**
*Q: "What was the admission type during the first hospital admission for patient 10021118?" (true: URGENT)*
- **control (1 tool):** "urgent — Encounter ID 24490144, `Encounter.priority`, code UR — urgent."
- **arm_ref (6 tools):** "urgent (`UR`)."
- Both correct; the generic tool actually returned *richer* structured detail.

**Case B — both correct, typed tools surface different breadth.**
*Q: "Has any lab test been performed on patient 10016150 in 2142?" (true: Yes)*
- **control:** "Yes — WBC 9.4 K/uL, 2142-05-11, final."
- **arm_ref:** "Yes — microbiology susceptibilities on 2142-05-21 (AMPICILLIN Resistant, TOBRAMYCIN Resistant, …)."
- Both answer "Yes" correctly. arm_ref's typed `search_observations` surfaces more varied result categories, but the *correctness* is identical — the difference is elaboration, not accuracy.

**Case C — identical answer (the modal pattern).**
*Q: "Has patient 10037975 been given a creatinine, urine test since 15 months ago?" (true: Yes)*
- **control & arm_ref:** both return "Yes — Creatinine, Urine, 2185-01-19T11:22, 52 mg/dL, final." Functionally identical.

**Takeaway from the traces:** typed tools don't unlock new *correctness* — they surface additional or differently-categorized data. For strong models on well-structured FHIR, the generic tool is already near-optimal, which is exactly why the curve is flat.

---

## 7. What it means + recommendation

**Do NOT claim "a generic FHIR tool is worse, so add a purpose-built tool catalog."** The data says the opposite. For strong models the single generic tool is plenty. If anything, this result **validates a minimalist single-tool design** — and it is exactly what the parent FHIR-AgentBench paper already found (generic 0.25 ≥ specialized 0.22; see §2). Claiming a confounded +11pp that the controls already disprove is a fast way to get refuted by anyone who reads the raw data.

**Instead, ship the methodology and the overflow finding as the contribution.** The accuracy result is null, but the *experiment* is the asset. You built a paired-McNemar + bootstrap + cap-factorial harness that **catches a confound a naive eval (RUN-0, and frankly most vendor eval blog posts) would have shipped as a win.** The reframed, defensible thesis:

> *"Across two frontier models on single-patient FHIR retrieval, a catalog of purpose-built FHIR tools showed no statistically significant accuracy advantage over Medplum's single generic `fhir_request` tool. The only robust effect was the model's context budget — `_include`/reference-resolution tools actively hurt because they overflow the default cap. FHIR agent ergonomics are governed by token economics, not tool count."*

That is true, specific, and useful to a Medplum maintainer — "I disproved my own promising result and traced it to a context-budget confound" beats "I found tools help."

**Keep scope cleanly separate.** This eval tests the **narrowest slice**: single-patient retrieval. Agent **aggregation/cohort** queries over FHIR — multi-patient analytics — are **explicitly out of scope of FHIR-AgentBench** (it excludes multi-patient questions). So a flat single-patient curve says **nothing** about the cohort/aggregate angle. Don't let this null get over-generalized into "tooling for FHIR agents doesn't matter." That broader question isn't tested here.

---

## 8. Limitations (state these loudly and first)

- **Underpowered.** n=25–30/cell. An 8pp effect cannot be resolved at this sample size (MDE would need ~n≥150). The honest claim is "no effect *detectable at this power*; the effect, if any, is ≤8pp and dwarfed by the cap effect" — **not** "tools definitively don't help."
- **8-tool endpoint incomplete.** All 30 arm_full8 records are quota errors; the 8-tool agent never ran. The strong form of the diminishing-returns hypothesis is untestable. Disclose this before anyone finds the RateLimitErrors.
- **Single benchmark, single-patient.** FHIR-AgentBench only, MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR demo (100 patients), single-patient retrieval QA. No cohort/aggregate coverage.
- **Single-attempt accuracy — no reliability metric.** Each question is scored once; we report no τ-bench-style `pass^k` reliability ([2406.12045](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12045)). With this n, run-to-run variance could rival the between-arm deltas we call null.
- **The 1→8 tool staircase is not chance-corrected.** A random-selection baseline grows with the number of tools, so a flat raw curve conflates capability with that tool-count-dependent baseline. A Bits-over-Random-style correction would be the right way to read the staircase; we don't apply one, so treat the curve as directional only.
- **Result is a replication, not a discovery.** The generic-vs-typed null was already reported intra-paper by FHIR-AgentBench (0.25 vs 0.22; §2), and "token economics dominate" is established context-bottleneck literature (Lost-in-the-Middle, RULER, RAG-MCP). The novel part is the *method bundle* + the manipulated-cap finding, not the headline number.
- **Both API accounts hit quota mid-experiment.** Anthropic, then OpenAI. Quota/cost management was the real operational bottleneck, and the `resolve_references`/`_include` cells are token-expensive on any model — itself part of the finding.
- **LLM-as-judge ground truth.** gpt-5-mini judge; *mitigated* by an independent crude deterministic re-score that reproduced the GPT-5.5 curve, so the directional conclusion is not judge-sensitive.
- **Judge uncalibrated.** No human gold set, Cohen's κ unmeasured, no inter-rater/ICC. The correctness labels are an unvalidated proxy, and judge noise biases *toward* the null — so the null result is the conclusion most exposed to this gap. The deterministic re-score (§9) is the partial mitigation, not a substitute for a calibrated judge.
- **Single seed per cell.** Run-to-run (decoding) variance is unmeasured. Each cell is one sample at one seed; the flat curve could hide seed-level wobble we never observed. A SOTA design would run ≥3 seeds/cell and report the variance component.
- **No multiple-comparison correction in the headline numbers.** The per-comparison p-values in §3 are uncorrected. After Holm-Bonferroni over the full family (§9), **only the cap-on-arm_ref effect survives** (p_holm=0.005); the cap-on-control effect (p=0.039) does **not** (p_holm=0.35). Secondary findings beyond the context-cap effect should be treated as exploratory.
- **No pre-registration.** Arms, slices, and the primary comparison were not pre-registered; the cap-factorial was added after RUN-0 surprised us. This is honest exploratory work, not a confirmatory trial.
- **Opus raw data lost** with its torn-down box (reproducibility hole) — there is **no committed Opus data anywhere in the repo**, so every Opus number and the cap-factorial finding are reconstructed (see §1). This was a real data-stewardship failure: the raw per-question artifacts were never pulled off the ephemeral box before its dead-man timer terminated it.
- **GPT-5.5 side recovered (2026-06-21).** The GPT-5.5 raw answers are committed; the judge correctness labels were *originally* lost (the scorer only wrote aggregates, and a re-run after the OpenAI judge died clobbered them with zeros). They have since been **regenerated** by re-judging the surviving committed answers with `gpt-5-mini` — per-question labels are now frozen in [`medplum-eval/results/*.judged.json`](../medplum-eval/results/) and aggregates in `_scores.csv` / `_paired.json`, so the GPT curve + paired stats are recomputable from committed data. (Re-judging is mildly non-deterministic, ~±3pp run-to-run; the committed `*.judged.json` labels are the frozen record. The fixes that prevent recurrence — per-question label persistence + fail-closed scoring — are in `score_taxonomy.py`.)

---

## 9. Robustness analysis (post-hoc, judge-free)

Three of the §8 gaps can be closed with **no re-run and no extra spend**, using only the saved per-question answers + benchmark ground truth. Script: [`robustness_analysis.py`](../robustness_analysis.py); full output: [`medplum-eval/ROBUSTNESS_ANALYSIS.txt`](../medplum-eval/ROBUSTNESS_ANALYSIS.txt). All three **reinforce the null and sharpen the one real finding.**

**9.1 — Judge-free deterministic re-score.** Re-scored every GPT-5.5 answer with a strict string/number match against the ground truth (no LLM in the loop) to check the conclusion isn't an artifact of a small uncalibrated judge.

| tools | arm | judge (raw) | deterministic (answerable-set) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | control | 0.80 | 0.57 |
| 2 | cat2 | 0.70 | 0.55 |
| 4 | cat4 | 0.80 | 0.61 |
| 5 | validated5 | 0.77 | 0.56 |
| 6 | arm_ref | 0.83 | 0.57 |

**The two columns use different denominators** — `judge (raw)` is correct / *all* questions; `deterministic` is correct / questions the strict scorer could grade (un-parseable answers dropped) — so the per-row gap is **not** a like-for-like comparison and shouldn't be read as a 20pp "error rate." The point is the **shape within each scorer**: the curve is **flat under both** (deterministic 0.55–0.61; judge 0.70–0.83), with control (1 tool) ≈ arm_ref (6 tools) either way. The flat/null pattern is robust to the scorer; only the absolute level is judge-dependent.

**9.2 — Minimum detectable effect (MDE).** Simulated paired-McNemar power at our n to report the smallest accuracy delta we were actually powered to detect.

| n | MDE (optimistic, e=.05) | MDE (conservative, e=.10) |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | 39 pp | 46 pp |
| 30 | 34 pp | 40 pp |

Under any plausible discordance-noise assumption the MDE is **~34–46pp**. The correct reading of the null is therefore **"no tool effect larger than ~the MDE,"** not "no effect." A commercially-decisive 5–10pp lift is far below this floor — **structurally invisible** to this design. This is the single most important honesty caveat: the experiment is badly underpowered for realistic effect sizes.

**9.3 — Holm-Bonferroni (family-wise correction).** Corrected the full family of **10** paired p-values (the 6 Opus comparisons + the 4 GPT-5.5 curve steps; full table in [`ROBUSTNESS_ANALYSIS.txt`](../medplum-eval/ROBUSTNESS_ANALYSIS.txt) §3). Representative rows:

| comparison | p | p_holm | survives? |
|---|---|---|---|
| opus med: cap effect on **arm_ref** (32k→100k) | 0.0005 | **0.005** | **YES** |
| opus med: cap effect on control (32k→100k) | 0.039 | 0.351 | no |
| opus med: structure-lift (control_include→arm_ref) | 0.69 | 1.0 | no |
| opus med: total-lift (control→arm_ref) | 0.625 | 1.0 | no |
| opus med: coaching-lift (control→control_include) | 1.0 | 1.0 | no |
| opus rep: control→arm_full8 | 1.0 | 1.0 | no |
| GPT-5.5 curve steps (1→2, 2→4, 4→5, 5→6), each | ≈1.0 | 1.0 | no |

After correction, **exactly one effect is credible: the `_include`/reference-resolution overflow at the 32k cap (p_holm=0.005).** Even the cap-on-control effect drops out. This is the cleanest possible statement of the result: the *only* thing that robustly moves accuracy, family-wise-corrected, is the context-budget trap — not tool count, not tool design.
