"""Combine the corrected deterministic layer + the 3-Claude-judge panel into TRUSTWORTHY labels, then
run the stratified analysis honestly (multiple stratum definitions, CIs, not just a bare p-value), and
quantify how unreliable the original gpt-5-mini judge was — WITHOUT conflating it with the harness bug.

Inputs (all committed/derivable):
  runs/full409/det_labels.json        - deterministic: failures->0 (any gold) + clean NUMERIC golds (build_labels.py)
  runs/full409/panel_votes.json       - Claude panel for the original 188 categorical/'other' questions
  runs/full409/panel_votes_new.json   - Claude panel for the 111 BOOLEAN questions (the grading-bug fix); optional
  runs/full409/judged_cache.json      - the old gpt-5-mini labels (for the disagreement audit)
